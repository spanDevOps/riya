Core Vision:

Your AI assistant app is a highly intelligent, personal, and functional assistant designed to improve the user's daily life. It starts as soon as it’s launched, listens actively, and performs a wide range of tasks—becoming an indispensable part of the user’s routine.
App Features:
User Interface:

    Inspired by ChatGPT’s UI:
        Clean, minimalist, and intuitive.
        Main interface includes a chat-like interaction space with support for voice input/output.
        Displays conversational threads for context and history.

    Always Listening:
        Starts listening to the user immediately upon launch.
        Users can interact through voice or text seamlessly.

Key Functionalities:

    Task Execution:
        Default Features (e.g., proactive services):
            Read news.
            Provide weather updates for the user's location or any specified location.
        Actionable Tasks:
            Update rows in your AppSheet database for the shopping helper app.
            Read and prioritize emails marked as important.
            Send, read, and organize text messages and WhatsApp messages.
            Place calls on behalf of the user.
            Notify the user of the caller’s identity when receiving calls.

    System Control:
        Device Settings:
            Toggle system settings such as:
                Dark mode on/off.
                Adjust volume or set it to silent/vibrate.
                Change brightness levels.
                Control screen lock/unlock.
            Launch any installed app upon request.

    Suggestions and Notifications:
        Proactively offer useful suggestions, such as:
            Reminders for important tasks/events.
            Notifying about unread important messages or updates.
        Inform the user of upcoming deadlines or missed actions.

    Interaction with User:
        Leverage device cameras for features like:
            Recognizing and responding to the user's emotions or gestures.
            Using visual input (e.g., scanning QR codes or identifying objects).
        Allow interactions via both voice and visual recognition.

    Advanced Tasks:
        Fetch data from APIs for user-specific requests (e.g., stock updates, sports scores).
        Provide navigation assistance, including route planning and live updates.

Technical Features:

    Integration with OpenAI APIs:
        Speech-to-Text (STT): OpenAI’s Whisper for accurate and real-time voice recognition.
        Text-to-Speech (TTS): Natural and conversational responses.
        GPT: To handle conversational and task-specific queries.
        Assistant API: For orchestrating multitask operations seamlessly.

    Memory System:
        Dynamic Memory Optimization:
            Only relevant context is sent to GPT, minimizing token usage.
        Long-Term Memory:
            Store essential information locally or in the cloud for long-term recall.
        Summarization:
            Prioritize crucial data using repetition weights and decay factors.

    Automation Support:
        Integrate with external APIs (e.g., weather, news, AppSheet database) for task-specific actions.
        Enable AppSheet app updates directly through voice commands.

User Experience (UX):

    Seamless Interaction:
        Always ready to respond without needing manual activation.
        Users can interact entirely via voice for a hands-free experience.
        Real-time response with minimal latency.

    Customization:
        Allow users to customize:
            Default tasks the assistant performs proactively.
            Preferences for notifications, voice, and app behavior.

    Proactive Intelligence:
        Use machine learning to understand user habits and anticipate needs:
            E.g., Suggest setting alarms, ordering groceries, or checking emails based on patterns.

Roadmap and Focus:

    Focus on the Android App:
        Dismiss the idea of a Custom ROM for now.
        Build a fully functional, standalone app with all core features and seamless OpenAI integration.

    Incremental Feature Rollouts:
        Phase 1: Core functionalities like task execution, system control, and OpenAI-powered conversational abilities.
        Phase 2: Proactive suggestions, memory optimization, and camera-based interactions.
        Phase 3: Advanced integrations (e.g., third-party APIs, emotion recognition).

Optimization and Goals:

    Token Efficiency:
        Use dynamic memory to reduce the size of GPT requests.
        Summarize conversations and prioritize crucial topics.

    Cost Management:
        Charge users a 15% markup on end-to-end query costs for transparency and fairness.
        Avoid hidden fees or subscriptions.

    User Privacy:
        Store sensitive data securely, with an option for users to control what stays local and what is uploaded to the cloud.

    Future-Proofing:
        Ensure the app is scalable and open to integrating new features as user needs evolve.
