# Automation Guide

## Understanding Automations

### What Are Automations?

Automations are custom sequences of actions that Riya can perform automatically based on:

- Voice triggers ("When I say...")
- Time ("Every morning at...")
- Location ("When I reach...")
- Events ("When I receive...")
- Conditions ("If battery is...")

## Creating Automations

### Basic Creation

```
"Hey Riya..."
- "create new automation"
- "set up routine"
- "make new sequence"
```

### Types of Triggers

```
Voice Triggers:
- "When I say 'movie time'..."
- "When I say 'good morning'..."
- "When I say 'work mode'..."

Time Triggers:
- "Every day at 8 AM..."
- "Every weekday at 6 PM..."
- "On weekends at 10 AM..."

Location Triggers:
- "When I reach home..."
- "When I arrive at office..."
- "When I leave [location]..."

Event Triggers:
- "When I receive an email..."
- "When battery is low..."
- "When someone rings doorbell..."
```

### Example Automations

```
1. Movie Mode:
"Hey Riya, create automation: when I say 'movie time':
- dim living room lights to 20%
- turn on TV
- set sound mode to theater
- turn on bias lighting"

2. Morning Routine:
"Hey Riya, create automation: every day at 7 AM:
- turn on bedroom lights slowly
- read weather forecast
- play morning playlist
- show calendar for today"

3. Work Mode:
"Hey Riya, create automation: when I reach office:
- set phone to vibrate
- open work apps
- check calendar
- send arrival message to team"
```

## Managing Automations

### View & Edit

```
"Hey Riya..."
- "show my automations"
- "list all routines"
- "edit [automation name]"
- "modify morning routine"
```

### Testing

```
"Hey Riya..."
- "test [automation name]"
- "run morning routine now"
- "simulate arrival home"
```

### Delete

```
"Hey Riya..."
- "delete [automation name]"
- "remove morning routine"
- "clear all automations"
```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

```
"Hey Riya, create automation:
when I leave home:
- if it's raining, remind me to take umbrella
- if battery below 50%, remind me to take charger
- if temperature below 20Â°C, turn on heater"
```

### Chained Automations

```
"Hey Riya, create automation:
when I say 'good night':
- run evening routine
- wait 10 minutes
- run security check
- if all clear, run sleep mode"
```

### Time Windows

```
"Hey Riya, create automation:
when doorbell rings:
- if between 9 AM and 9 PM, announce visitor
- if after 9 PM, send security camera feed to phone"
```
